# HelloUnirest

This project demonstrates how to use the most basic features of the Mashape Unirest Java library in a 'Hello World' program.  It also uses Google GSON to deserialize an object.  It communicates with the test website httpbin.  

For convenience, this project includes a rudimentary maven build script in the base directory, and two invocation scripts in the bin directory.
